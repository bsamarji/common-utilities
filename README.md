# common-utilities
Python scripts that perform common utilities.
Built using python 3.13

### What is this repository for? ###
Each python script has been written to perform one function or utility commonly performed by programmers in their daily lives.
Each script was created to automate a tedious job to improve efficiencies in workflows and pipelines.

### How do I get set up? ###
* Feel free to clone the repository and use the scripts for yourself.
* Check the requirements.txt file and initialise the requirements using the init command in Makefile.
* The scripts were all written as CLIs (command line interfaces).
This is so you can pass arguments to the script from a terminal, making the scripts softcoded and re-usable.
* Running each script using the -h or --help argument will bring up the documentation for each script.
* Each script does what is says on the tin (or file name for this matter).
